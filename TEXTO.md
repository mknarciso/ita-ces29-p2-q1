Our company, South Coast Nautical Supplies, sells sailing supplies. Our catalogs feature items such as Global Positioning Systems, clocks, weather equipment, navigation and plotting equipment, life rafts, inflatable vests, charts, maps and books.
Our boss has decided we should finally start selling things over the Internet. However, rather than start by selling some of our bigger ticket items, he wants us to start by selling just books. Some items in our catalog cost over $10,000 and we don't want to take any risk with expensive items. After some months of successful on-line sales, we'll offer the rest of our products on the site. Last thing: the boss says the site needs to be live in thirty days so we can capture increased sales during the peak sailing months.

The project needs a customer to help us identify and write stories. The customers are the sailors who buy the books and they are all outside the company. So, we need an internal customer who can act as a proxy for the real end-user customers. For this the boss designates Lori, who is the vice president of Sales and Marketing.

In an initial meeting with Lori she provides more background on the system she needs. She wants a "typical bookstore/eCommerce site." She wants customers to be able to search for books in a variety of ways (it depends on the kind of customer), she wants users to
be able to maintain lists of books they'll buy later, she wants users to rate and review books they buy, and she wants to them users check on the status of an order. We've seen plenty of sites like this so we tell Lori we're ready to start.

During the meeting Lori also clarifies the most common classes of customers for our books, from the most important to the least important:

Hard Core Sailor: Generally inexperienced with computers. Buys lots of additional equipment from us. Usually knows exactly what book he's looking for. Doesn't want to feel stupid while trying to use the site.

Novice Sailor: Experienced web shopper. Is sometimes referred to a specific title; other times needs help selecting the right book. Wants more help in selecting appropriate books (good content written at the appropriate level) than she gets in a physical bookstore.

Non-Sailing Gift Buyer: Usually proficient with computers (or would not chose to purchase a gift online). Not a sailor and will have passing familiarity at best with sailing terms. Will usually be after a very specific book but may be looking for a book on a given topic. Will enjoy options such as gift wrapping and special packaging, deliveries at specific dates, and the possibility of buying gift cards.
